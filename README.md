# 13ft
I decided to make this after seeing https://12ft.io could not work on the New York Times.
<br>
12ft.io is a website that uses google's cache to bypass paywalls for news websites. This is possible because the websites do not paywall google's indexing bot to allow their content to appear in search results. However, when the user navigates to the website, the content will be paywalled.
<br>
I noticed using Google's term highlighting system, the page will not be paywalled.
<br>
This is done by passing the highlighting stuff into the URL, but not actually selecting any text.
